# Made it cuz I wanna entangle three :)

So remember our 2 qubit Bell state which basically entagling 2 qubits together, so how about entangling 3 qubits?

Turns out you can do that with something known as teh W-state Circuit which entagles 3 qubits in states |001> |010> and |100>

Now one of the important theoretical observation is that their state is wriiten as:
## (1/✓3)(|001> + |010> + |100>)

Which tells us that the probaility of each occuring is (1/✓3)^2 = 1/3 = 0.33
This is pretty much what we got from the simulation :D
